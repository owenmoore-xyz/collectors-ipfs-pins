# collectors-ipfs-pins
Public registry for collectors of my artwork; IPFS pin urls for artwork and any related files I am providing to collectors of my work via blockchain tokens. Everything listed in this repository will be pinned on a home based IPFS node that I run using a Raspberry Pi 4 for the purposes of ensuring persistent access to the data. I encourage collectors of my work to also pin the `CID` hashes to ensure artwork you have paid for remains available (ex: Use a service like Pinata for artwork you own). Please **be patient** when downloading these files, as it may be slow.
